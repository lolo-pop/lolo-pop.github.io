I am Chenghao Rong, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in [Institute for Network Science and Cyberspace](https://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn) of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Hui Wang](https://jessiehuiwang.github.io/). Before this, I received the B.S. degree from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn) in 2015 and the M.S. degree from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn) in 2018. 

Research interests: edge computing, video analytics and serverless. My research works integrate the features of edge computing and machine learning to improve the performance and reliability of large-scale edge systems.
